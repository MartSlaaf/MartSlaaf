### Hi there ğŸ‘‹, Yaroslav {Martolod Slaaf} Zharov talking!

<!--
**MartSlaaf/MartSlaaf** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a PhD student @ KIT university. Doing fancy DL for physicists and biologists bounded to X-Ray tomography. Interested in all weak supervision stuff around.

If you are interested in collaboration or just a chit-chat related to what am I doing, feel free to contact me via [telegram](https://t.me/martolod).

Things I do:
- ğŸ¦® I started [Self Supervised Boy](https://t.me/selfsupervised) channel. Making papers summaries for everything not-so-supervised.
- ğŸ”ª Wrote [Torch Volume Slicing Dataset](https://github.com/MartSlaaf/TVSD). If you want to train a 2D networks from 3D data, go check it.
- ğŸ§µ Simple python [cross-stitch](https://github.com/MartSlaaf/cross-stitch) converter, to make cross-stitch scheme out of your image. Simple, yet worthy image processing inside.
